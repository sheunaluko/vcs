normal glucose tolerance
significant decreases in maternal and sun requirements in early gestation in when with type 1 diabetes

pics of increases are seen in insulin secretion in response to iv glucose challenge with inventing gestation

takeaway of the first set of charge is that insulin sensitivity increases and later just station

compared with the varied metabolic alterations in early pregnancy consensus has been reached regarding to decrease in peripheral insulin sensitivity in late gestation

the decrease in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy has been ascribed to an increased production of various placental and maternal hormones such as human placental lactogen progesterone estrogen and cortisol and prolactin

tnf-alpha was the strongest independent predictor of insulin sensitivity and pregnancy accounting for about half of the variance and decrease in insulin sensitivity

the principal glucose transporter in the placenta is glute one which is located in the sink ciccio trophoblast
glute one is located on both the microvilli send baseball membranes

genetic cause of diabetes such as maturity onset diabetes of youth exist the most common of which is type to which involves irritation and glucokinase gene
2.5% of women with gestational diabetes mellitus in the uk have glucose mutation
prevalence of overweight diabetes type 1 is increased by 47%
because of the complete dependence on executive since i'm pregnant women with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for dka


in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes of 50% decrease in insulin sensitivity was observed only in late gestation no significant difference was found in insulin sensitivity in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes in early pregnancy or within one week of delivery


type 2 DM 
lifetime risk of both twins developing type 2 ranges between 58 - 100% suggesting strong genetic component  

All pregannacy women appeared to have dcrease in expression onf insulin receptor substrate 1 


AMINO ACID 
15% increase in protein synthesis occurs during second trimester and furthere increases in thirtd by 25%
- potential role of placental amino acid transporters in dev of fetal macrosomi a in women with Diabetes currently unkown 

LIPID 
-maternal FFA concentrations correlated with ultrasound estimates of neonatal abdominal circumference and anthropometric estimations of neonatal fat mass at delivery 


Maternal weight gain and energy expenditrurn  
estimates of energy cost of prenancy range from 80,000 kcal to savings of 10000kcal 
- mean inscreas in basal metabolic rate in western women raletive to nonregnancy nonlactatinc control was 20 to 5%


FETAL DEMISE 
stillbirth rates in prenancyies linked to chronic intrauterine hypoxia  
- extramedullary heamtopoiesis supports this as likely causes ... umbinical cord samples with etal erythremia
- alteration in rbc oxygen releast 

CONGENTIAL MALFORMATIONS 
are most importatnt cause of perinatla loss in pregnancies type I and type II DM (30-50 % perinatal mortality) 
2 - 6 fold increase in malformations in type 1 and 2 dm 
* insult acts before 7th week 
- CNS , acnencephaly open spina bifida, holoprosencephay incerased 10 fold 
cardiac most common  
ABNORMAL embrogenesis 

MACROSOMIA 
- 4000 
50% pregnancies in women with GDM and 40% with 1/2  
increase in fat mass

HYPOGLYCEMIA
- exceeds 50% in macrosomic newborns 

RDS
experiemental animal stueis have provided evidence that hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can affect surfactant
- several studeis suggest that women with well controlled diabetes delivering at 38-9 weeks have no higherr riskk of RDS

NEPRHOPATHY 
- ace and ARB contraindicated during preg because may result n fetal proximal tubal dysgenesis ad oligohydramnios 


suboptimal control of blood pressure has been associated with a significantly increased risk for preterm delivery in pregnant women with diabetic nephropathy

no deleterious effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy is apparent provided that serum creatinine is in the normal range and significant proteinuria is absent in early pregnancy
changes in creatinine clearance are variable during pregnancy in women with diabetic nephropathy


RETINOPATHY 
CLASS r - proliferative retiopathy 
progression of diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy is associated with retinal status at inception, duration and early onset of diabetes, elevted first trimester hba1c and poor control , htn 
for women with proliferative changes laser photocoagulation is indicated and most will respond
