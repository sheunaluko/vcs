# Interactive Vuetify Frontend for VCS

This provides interactive UI integration to the speech command workflows. More documentation pending. In comparison, 
the VCS client at vcs/src/cient/index.html is easier to get started with but is only able to forward user text to VCS core. The current Vue front end, however, also connects to the UI websocket port and enables realtime visualazation of VCS core command states. Again, more documentation/ examples are pending...
