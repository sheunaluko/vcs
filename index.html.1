<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) US State Data Tracking Project</h2>

<h3>Record of official data from US government websites for the 50 states and DC.
	All data provided here are direct crawls of state government websites. These
	are the officially reported numbers. Unlike other coronavirus data sites, we do not rely on
	news or human crowd-sourced data. These are automatic captures of official state websites.
	Todo is to certify this data on the blockchain.
	(All websites last crawled: 2020-03-20 18:40:42 UTC)</h3>
