Design decisions to be made 


[ ] implment lssync and then load it, then do |  lssync.connect(document.location.href) ; lssync.mirror() 
- this should save  all the local storage to the remote db 
[ ] will implement menuX extension for lssync which triggers the above code using a user friendly button in menuX 

-> once the LS is mirrored, it can be accessed via native programs using a request containing document.location.href and the data fields 
- !!!! HMM !!  actually - > maybe I should be piping from lssync client to WS to a javascript object data base? can do this via MONGO or similar - CONSIDER -> how will i parse the data in R 
-- SOLUTION MONGO DB
