	Yes, this is universal for the given U. We can start by considering the most significant digit, and note that there are 10 possibilities for this digit, with equal likelihood. For each of these possibilities, the middle significant digit can take on 10 possibilities each indepentent of the most signifiant digit and each with equal probability (100 combinations of most + middle). Similarly, with the least signficiant there are 10 possibilities and they are indepenent leading to 1000 combinations of most + middle +least. Thus, regardless of whether we choose h1,h2,or h3, the probability P[h(ui)=h(uj)] = 1/n where n is 10, proving the property of universal hash family.
