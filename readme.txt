- HOW TO RUN:

1) cd into ./src/nodejs/ and run 'node'
2) enter: vcs = require("./main.js")
3) in another terminal cd into ./src/client and run "yarn" then "yarn run serve"
4) Open the browser and navigate to the specified port on localhost e.g. http://localhost:$PORT

- At this point voice detected by the browser should be forwarded to vcs, use the
-- node repl to debug.
