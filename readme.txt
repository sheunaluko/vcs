- HOW TO RUN:

1) cd into ./src/nodejs/ and run 'node'
2) enter: vcs = require("./main.js")
3) in another terminal cd into ./src/client and run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
4) Open the browser and navigate to ./src/client/index.html

- At this point voice detected by the browser should be forwarded to vcs, use the
-- node repl to debug.
