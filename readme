VCS (Voice Control System) allows you to use your voice to control your computer in arbitrary ways (by writing your own voice
commands)... interacting both with information from the web or with programs running locally on your computer.
Javascript and python are the built into VCS and can be readily started with. Other languages are possible as well. 

To get started, follow the instructions below. 

1) Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.io/sheunaluko/vcs.git 
``` 

2) Install the necessary node modules in the root directory 
``` 
cd vcs; npm install 
``` 

3) Launch VCS ! From the project root, run the following 
``` 
node src/nodejs/main.js --no-db 
``` 

4) In order to begin voice programing, there is one last step. You need to serve the VCS front end which actually connects 
your microphone using the web browser. Currently, a google speech to text server is used and the text is forwarded to VCS. 
VCS itself does not track your audio input, though we want to be transparent about the current use of google's (free) api. 
```
cd src/client 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

5) Open google chrome browser to the url, "localhost:8000" and accept the microphone access. Now, try asking **"ARE YOU THERE?"**
What about trying **"HOW ARE YOU?"**

That should get you up and running, and the full world of javascript voice commands is now at your disposal. If you prefer
programming in python however, you can follow the instructions below to enable python voice command writing 

6a) Install the python environment using a virtualenv (ensure that python3.7 and virtualenv are installed first) 
``` 
cd src/python/ 
virtualenv --python=python3.7 . 
source bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

6b) After VCS is already running (step 3 above) and you are within the activated python virtual environment as outlined above (6a), 
you can connect the python modules by running the following: 
```
python csi_adapter.py
```
Now, you are all set to write python commands voice commands too! Both javascript and python commands can call eachother.
